Adidas Gymnastics clothing e-commerce website.

Running on an old Coldfusion code base, this websites requires a lot of maintenance and added features which I am responsible for, as well as server maintenance and general web admin. What makes this project interesting in my eyes, is that I needed to learn a new Web development language and framework from scratch.

This is the first large scale website with active international customers that I am solely responsible for. It's a challenging and rewarding experience.
