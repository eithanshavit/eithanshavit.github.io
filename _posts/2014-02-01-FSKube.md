excerpt: Rubik's cubers use a special timer to competitively time themselves. My friend Jeremy (he's a cuber, I'm not) wanted feed data from the timer to his phone. I helped him build the hardware.

I recently helped a friend with a project to connect his competitive Rubik's cube timer to an iPhone. From a hardware perspective it is a very interesting challenge. I would say more, but he wrote a really nice blog post about it. Check out Jeremy's post at [jflei.com](http://www.jflei.com).
