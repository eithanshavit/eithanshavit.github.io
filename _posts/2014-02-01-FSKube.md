Rubik's cubers use a special timer to competitively time themselves. My friend Jeremy (he's a cuber, I'm not) wanted to feed data from the timer to his phone. I helped him build the hardware.

The timer has a digital output through a standard headphone jack. We wanted to connect it to the mic input on the iPhone. Unfortunately it's not that simple...

I helped Jeremy build a modem to translate the signal so that it can be recorded on any smartphone using the standard headphone jack. It was a very interesting challenge. I would say more, but he wrote a really nice blog post about it. Check out Jeremy's post at [jflei.com](http://www.jflei.com).
