This is a customized WordPress PHP website.

It is a recipe blog, combined with creative short stories. My good friend is the writer, cook, and photographer, while I build and maintain the website, and edit the photos.

To develop and launch the website, I used an Amazon Web Services VPS. Since this is a non-profit website, the virtual server we used had very limited resources. This brought up some scalability challenges, as more and more people started to use our website. To run a real website on a VM with less than 5% CPU time and 600Mb RAM, some MySql, Apache and virtual memory tricks were used. When development was done, we moved to a shared hosting solution in order to save some money.

It's great fun working on such a website that combines art, food, and web development.
