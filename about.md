Hi everyone,  
My name is Eithan Shavit. I am a Software engineer, I have a degree in Electrical Engineering, but what I really love is working on UX. I'm drawn to art and creativity and I'm always looking for new mediums through which to express my creativity, especially through technology. And the quest to use the right and the left sides of my brain together never ends.

This website is an attempt to document my experiments with various mediums such as web development, photography, hardware design, mobile apps, and carpentry.

I'm currently working on a very exciting mobile app. It's too early to talk about it, so I'll keep you posted.

Please contact me at *EithanShavit at gmail dot com*.
