Hello, I'm Eithan Shavit. I am an engineering manager at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com), and I love working on products and building great user experiences. I'm drawn to arts and creativity and I'm always looking for new mediums through which to express my creativity. Always trying to use the right and left sides of my brain.
